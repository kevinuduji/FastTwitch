# FastTwitch
A story board for a future workout app for track athletes

Formulated the idea and modeled a prototype using XCodeâ€™s storyboard for a mobile virtual track coaching app that eliminates the hassle of researching and planning workouts and offers customized training, including video APIs for guidance. Made during HackTX.

MY NEXT GOAL FOR FAST TWITCH IS TO IMPROVE THE FUNCTIONALITY AND MAKE THE APPLICATION LOOK MORE VISUALLY APPEALING
